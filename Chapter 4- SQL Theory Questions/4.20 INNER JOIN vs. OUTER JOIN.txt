Q. What are the critical differences between INNER JOIN and OUTER JOIN?
-The most critical difference between INNER JOIN and OUTER JOIN lies in the way they behave when there are unmatched rows between the joined tables.

Note: OUTER JOIN is also known as FULL JOIN or FULL OUTER JOIN.

INNER JOIN
INNER JOIN returns only the matching rows from both tables based on the join condition.

Unmatched rows from either table are excluded from the result set.

Example
SELECT Orders.order_id, Customers.customer_id 
FROM Orders
INNER JOIN Customers
ON Orders.customer_id = Customers.customer_id;

This query joins the Orders and Customers tables based on their common customer_id columns.

Then, it retrieves the order_id and customer_id columns from the joined tables, selecting only those records that have matching customer_id values in both the Orders and Customers tables.

OUTER JOIN
OUTER JOIN returns all the matching and unmatched rows from both tables, even if there are no matches in the other table.

Example
SELECT Orders.order_id, Customers.customer_id
FROM Orders
OUTER JOIN Customers
ON Orders.customer_id = Customers.customer_id; 

This query performs an OUTER JOIN, returning all the values of order_id from Orders and customer_id from Customers.

In the result set, unmatched columns will have NULL values.

In other words, if there's an order given by a customer whose customer_id is not in the Customers table, their customer_id will be displayed as NULL.

Similarly, if a customer in the Customers table has not given any orders, their order_id will be NULL.

Note: Our compiler is based on SQLite, which doesn't support OUTER JOIN.
