TASK:
Write an SQL query to retrieve the emp_id, first_name, last_name, and a column called salary_category which should display:

High for salaries greater than or equal to 5000.
Medium for salaries between 4000 and 4999.
Low for salaries below 4000.

SQL:
SELECT e.emp_id, e.first_name, e.last_name, 
    (SELECT 
    CASE WHEN s.salary >=5000 THEN 'High' 
         WHEN s.salary >4000 AND s.salary <5000 THEN 'Medium' 
         WHEN s.salary <4000 THEN 'Low' END) AS salary_category
FROM Employees as e
JOIN Salaries as s
ON e.emp_id= s.emp_id
