Q. An SQL trigger with its example.
A: An SQL trigger is a code that automatically executes when a specific event occurs in a database management system, such as inserting, updating, or deleting data.

For example, imagine you have a Students table in a school database. Whenever a new student is inserted into the table, you'll want to automatically generate a unique student ID.

So, you can write an SQL trigger that executes automatically after every insert operation on the Students table.

This code can generate a unique student ID based on predefined rules and automatically assign it to the newly inserted student data.

Here's how you can create and use a trigger in MySQL:

CREATE TRIGGER trg_generate_student_id
BEFORE INSERT ON Students
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
  DECLARE next_id INT;

  -- Get the next available student ID
  SELECT MAX(student_id) + 1 INTO next_id FROM Students;

  -- If the table is empty, set the initial student ID to 1
  IF next_id IS NULL THEN
    SET next_id = 1;
  END IF;

  -- Set the generated student ID for the new student
  SET NEW.student_id = next_id;
END;


Note: Triggers in SQL can have different syntax depending on the DBMS used.
