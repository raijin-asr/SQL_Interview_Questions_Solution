Q. How are Indexes significant in a database?
-An index in a database is a data structure that improves the speed and efficiency of data retrieval operations.

Just like an index in a book helps you quickly find specific information, indexes in databases help the database system locate data faster.

Imagine you have an extensive library with thousands of books. If you want to find a book about a specific topic, it would be time-consuming to search through every book.

But if the library has an index that lists the topics and the corresponding book locations, you can easily find the book you need.

The index is a shortcut, allowing you to jump directly to the relevant information without searching every book.

Similarly, database indexes work by creating a sorted structure based on specific columns in a table. These indexes help the database system locate data efficiently.
