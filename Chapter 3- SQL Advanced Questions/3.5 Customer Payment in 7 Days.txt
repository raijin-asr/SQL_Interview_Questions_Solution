TASK:
Write an SQL query to compute the moving average (as average_amount) of how much the customers paid in a seven days window (i.e., current day + 6 days before).

Here, average_amount should be rounded to two decimal places.

SQL:
SELECT visited_on,
       ROUND(AVG(amount) 
	OVER(ORDER BY visited_on 
	ROWS BETWEEN 6 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW),2) 
AS average_amount
FROM Customers;
