Q. What is a subquery in SQL, and how is it different from a regular query?
A subquery in SQL, also known as a nested query or inner query, is a query embedded within another query. It allows you to use the results of one query as a part of another query.

The subquery is enclosed within parentheses and typically placed within the outer query's WHERE, HAVING, or FROM clause.

Here are the main differences between a query and a subquery:

Query	
A regular query retrieves data from one or more tables and performs filtering, sorting, and other operations on the data.
A regular query is executed independently and can be run separately to fetch data from the database.
A regular query can operate on multiple tables or combines tables together to fetch data.
A regular query can be used to nest various subqueries to solve more complex and intricate querying.

Subquery
A subquery is used as a component or part of another query to provide additional information.
A subquery cannot be executed alone since it relies on the context of the outer query.
A subquery is typically used to filter or retrieve a subset of data based on certain conditions or calculations performed within the subquery.
Subqueries can be nested, meaning a subquery can contain another subquery within it.
