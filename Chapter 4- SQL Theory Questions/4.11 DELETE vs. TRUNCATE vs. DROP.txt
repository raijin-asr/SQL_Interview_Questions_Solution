Q. How are DELETE, TRUNCATE, and DROP statements different in SQL?

a. DELETE Statement
The DELETE statement removes specific rows from a table based on the specified conditions. For example,

DELETE FROM table_name
WHERE condition;

b. TRUNCATE Statement
The TRUNCATE statement removes all rows from a table, effectively deleting all the data.

Unlike the DELETE statement, TRUNCATE does not require specifying any condition and is faster because it removes all the rows at once.

For example,
TRUNCATE TABLE table_name;

c. DROP Statement
The DROP statement deletes an entire table from the database. It removes both the table structure and all the associated data.

This operation is irreversible, and once a table is dropped, all the data and schema associated with it are permanently deleted. For example,

DROP TABLE table_name;
