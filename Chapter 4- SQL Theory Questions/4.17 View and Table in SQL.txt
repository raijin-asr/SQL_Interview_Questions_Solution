Q. How is a View different from a Table in SQL?
-In SQL, a view and a table are database objects that store and retrieve data.

However, there are significant differences between them regarding their nature and functionality:

-Data Storage
A table in SQL is a physical entity that stores data directly. At the same time, a view is a virtual table that does not have storage.

Views are created based on queries and retrieve data from one or more underlying tables.

-Data Modification
Tables allow direct data modification operations such as INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE, while views are primarily used for data retrieval.

While some views allow limited modifications, they generally have restrictions and are unsuitable for extensive data modification.

-Structure
Tables have a fixed structure defined by columns with specific data types. Each row represents a record, and each column represents an attribute.

Views, on the other hand, do not have a fixed structure. They are created by defining a query that retrieves data from tables, allowing for flexible combinations and transformations of data.

-Abstraction and Security
Views provide an additional layer of abstraction and security. They can present a simplified and tailored data view, hiding certain columns or performing calculations.

Views can also control access to underlying data by granting users access to the view while restricting direct access to the tables, enhancing security measures.
