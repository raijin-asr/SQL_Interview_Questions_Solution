Q. Is there a way to handle NULL values in SQL queries?
A: Yes, there are four primary approaches to handling NULL values:

1. Check Column for NULL
-You can use the IS NULL (or IS NOT NULL) operator to check if a column value is NULL. For example,

SQL Code:
SELECT *
FROM Customers
WHERE last_name IS NULL;


2. Return NULL After Comparison
-Use the NULLIF() function to compare two expressions and return NULL if they are equal. Else, return the first expression.
-For example, the query below displays those values of the last_name column that are not NULL.

SQL Code:
SELECT NULLIF(last_name, NULL) AS last_name
FROM Customers;

-Here, we have provided two arguments to the NULLIF() function: last_name and NULL. The function then compares the values of these two arguments.
-If they are equal i.e., if last_name is equal to NULL, then NULLIF() returns a NULL value.
-If they are not equal i.e., if last_name is not equal to NULL, then NULLIF() returns the first argument (the value in the last_name column).

3. Replace NULL With Alternative Value
-With the COALESCE() function, you can replace a NULL value with an alternative value.
-For example, we can replace a NULL value with N/A for customers without a last name as shown below:

SQL Code:
SELECT COALESCE(last_name, 'N/A') AS last_name
FROM Customers;

4. Logically Handle NULL
-Properly using the CASE statement can help you logically handle NULL values. For example,

SQL Code:
SELECT first_name,
  CASE
    WHEN last_name IS NULL THEN 'N/A'
    ELSE last_name
  END AS last_name
FROM Customers;
