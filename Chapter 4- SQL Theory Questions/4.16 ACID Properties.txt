Q. What is ACID in the context of database transactions?
-ACID is a set of properties that ensures reliability and integrity in database transactions. It is an acronym for Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability. Here's what it means:

-Atomicity
Atomicity means that a transaction is treated as a single, indivisible unit. It either succeeds or fails. There is no partial execution.

It's like a light switch that turns on or off, with no in-between state.

-Consistency
Consistency ensures that a transaction brings the database from one valid state to another.

In other words, the data should follow predefined rules or constraints.

For example, if a constraint specifies that a customer's age must be above 18, a transaction should not allow a customer below 18 to be added to the database.

-Isolation
Isolation means that concurrent transactions do not interfere with each other. Each transaction is isolated and operates as if it is the only transaction running on the database.

This prevents problems like data inconsistencies or conflicts when multiple transactions access or modify the same data simultaneously.

-Durability
Durability guarantees that once a transaction is committed, its changes are permanent and will survive any subsequent system failures, such as power outages or crashes.

The changes made by the transaction are stored durably, typically in non-volatile storage like Hard drives, to ensure they can be recovered and restored even after a failure.
