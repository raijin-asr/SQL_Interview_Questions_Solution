Q. How can you use a HAVING clause in SQL?
-The HAVING clause in SQL filters the results of a query based on conditions that involve aggregate functions. It is similar to the WHERE clause but operates on groups of rows rather than individual rows.

Consider the table below:
Table - Sales

sales_id	region	sales	month
1	        New York	3500	March
2	        Alaska	108	January
3	        California	4000	January
4	        Texas	1000	October
5	        California	2000	June
6	        Texas	5000	December
7	        New York	4300	September


To find regions with total sales greater than 6000, we can use the HAVING clause as follows:

SELECT region, SUM(sales) AS total_sales
FROM Sales
GROUP BY region
HAVING SUM(sales) > 6000;
This query groups the sales by region, calculates the total sales for each region using the SUM() function, and then filters the result using the HAVING clause to include only regions with total sales greater than 6000.


Thus, the result set will be:
region	total_sales
New York	7800
