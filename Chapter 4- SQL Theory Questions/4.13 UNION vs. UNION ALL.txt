Q. How are UNION and UNION ALL different in SQL?
-While both UNION and UNION ALL are used to combine the results of multiple SELECT statements into a single result set, there is one key difference between the two.

UNION removes duplicate rows from the combined result set. On the other hand, UNION ALL does not remove duplicate rows from the combined result set.

Consider the following two tables:
Table - Midlands

team_id	name
3	    Spurs
4	    United
5	    Liverpool

Table - London

team_id	name
1	    Chelsea
2	    Arsenal
3	    Spurs   


UNION
SELECT team_id, name
FROM London
UNION
SELECT team_id, name
FROM Midlands;

Output
team_id	name
1	    Chelsea
2	    Arsenal
3	    Spurs
4	    United
5	    Liverpool


UNION ALL
SELECT team_id, name
FROM London
UNION ALL 
SELECT team_id, name
FROM Midlands;

Output(also duplicate)
team_id	name
1	    Chelsea
2	    Arsenal
3	    Spurs
3	    Spurs
4	    United
5	    Liverpool
