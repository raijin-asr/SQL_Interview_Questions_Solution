Q. What is data integrity, and what constraints are used to ensure it?
A: Data integrity refers to the accuracy, consistency, and reliability of data stored in a database. It ensures that the data is valid and remains consistent throughout its lifecycle.

Various constraints are used in a database to maintain data integrity.

For instance, the primary key constraint ensures that each row in a table has a unique identifier. It prevents duplicate or NULL values in the primary key column.

Similarly, foreign key constraints establish relationships between tables, ensuring that the values in the foreign key column match those in the referenced table's primary key column.

Unique constraints enforce uniqueness in a column or a set of columns.

Check constraints define conditions the data must satisfy, such as data range or format.

Finally, Not NULL constraints ensure that a column always has a value and cannot contain NULL.
