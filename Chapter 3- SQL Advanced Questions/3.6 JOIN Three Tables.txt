TASK:
Write an SQL query to retrieve the customer_id, first_name, last_name, and a column called payment_status which should display:

Paid if the total amount of payments for a customer is greater than or equal to 300.
Unpaid if the total amount of payments for a customer is less than 300.

SQL:
SELECT c.customer_id, c.first_name, c.last_name, (CASE WHEN p.amount >= 300 THEN 'Paid' ELSE 'Unpaid' END) AS payment_status
FROM Customers as c
LEFT JOIN Orders as o
ON c.customer_id= o.customer_id
LEFT JOIN Payments as p
ON o.order_id = p.order_id
GROUP BY c.customer_id, c.first_name, c.last_name
