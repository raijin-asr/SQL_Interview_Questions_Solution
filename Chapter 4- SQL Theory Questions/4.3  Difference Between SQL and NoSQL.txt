Q. How are SQL and NoSQL different?
--There are two dominant approaches to managing data:

1. SQL databases
2. NoSQL databases

--SQL databases store data in related tables of rows and columns. On the other hand, NoSQL databases store unstructured or semi-structured data such as documents and images.

Primary differences between the two databases:

SQL----
--SQL stands for Structured Query Language.
--They are relational databases with data stored in related tables of rows and columns.
--They store highly structured and (ideally) normalized data.
--They are ideal for structured data of small or medium size.
--Operations like migrating the database or making structural changes are relatively easy as long as the developer possesses knowledge of the database components.
--Performance can be boosted by upgrading the server hardware (vertical scaling).
--Primarily used for business and transactional applications.
--Examples of SQL DBMS include MySQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL, MS SQL Server, etc.

NoSQL----
--NoSQL stands for Not only SQL.
--They are non-relational databases containing data stored in key-value pairs, graphs, or documents.
--They store unstructured or semi-structured data.
--They are ideal for vast datasets.
--Migrating or making structural changes might be very difficult even if the developer possesses knowledge of the database components.
--Performance can be boosted by adding new servers (horizontal scaling).
--Primarily used for big data and social media applications.
--Examples of NoSQL DBMS include MongoDB, Cassandra, Amazon DynamoDB, Bigtable, etc.
